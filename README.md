# Defi Empire-  A Simple DeFI Kingdom Clone

## Description
DeFi Kingdoms is a highly complex decentralized finance application that cannot be fully comprehended in just a few hours. Therefore, in this discussion, we will only be covering the fundamentals related to custom subnet development, as this is what we are most interested in learning about. If you're looking to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the platform, we highly recommend reading the official documentation. There is a wealth of information available that can help you gain insight into how it was implemented and how you can build on top of it if you're interested. So let's focus on the custom subnet development aspects of DeFi Kingdoms and explore the exciting opportunities and possibilities that this feature offers.

### Getting Started
1. To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

2. Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the code from contract.sol file into your file:

3. To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to latest solidity version (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile" button.

4. Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the your contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

5. Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the requireInstance, assertInstance and revertInstance function.
